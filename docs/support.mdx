    #### FAQ's
    <Accordion title="Where are my saved snippets stored?">
        The Pieces Suite must be downloaded and installed separately from the Chrome Extension in order for the extension to work properly.
        When you save code snippets with Pieces, they are stored locally in the Pieces desktop app.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What does the share button do?">
        When you click the Share button below a code block, Pieces generates a link that is specifically designed to share useful code with its context— it's automatically copied to your clipboard once it's generated.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How do I remove the Pieces buttons from a site?">
        If you don't want the Pieces buttons to appear on a certain website, you can disable the Pieces buttons for that site in the extension settings.
        1. Right-click the Pieces icon in the top right corner of your browser and choose “Options”
        2. Toggle the "Disable Pieces buttons" option. The page will automatically refresh and the Pieces buttons will disappear.
