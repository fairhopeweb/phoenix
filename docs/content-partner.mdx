## What are examples of good content?

    <p><strong>Good technical content means that developers came away more knowledgeable on a particular topic.</strong></p>
    <p>Good content also naturally places Pieces functionality in your content. This can include using Pieces shareable links, creating Pieces snippet collections with a single link download, highlighting a particular Pieces integration and how it impacts your topic and more.</p>

    <p>If you’re not sure how to include Pieces in your content, we can help you. In almost every piece of technical content, we believe there is a way that Pieces functionality can make your content more useful for the audience.</p>
