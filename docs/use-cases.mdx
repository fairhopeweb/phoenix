        - Save code from the web and then auto-complete it in your IDE a few seconds later
        - Replace your code snippet bookmarks in your browser (plus, they’re searchable)
        - Save boilerplate code or have it saved automatically for you with auto-save
        - Save alternative algorithms or pseudocode that isn’t ready for production
        - Save code when resolving merge conflicts, just in case
        - Save interesting snippets of code instead of starring or forking the entire repo for just a few lines
        - Save resources and lightweight libraries that help you solve problems without large overhead or third-party dependencies
        - Auto-complete READMEs, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT with standardized information within and across projects
        - Temporarily save code you’ll need to move soon
        - Save screenshots from multiple repos and compare them back-to-back to find errors where git pulls/merges/PRs have been improperly managed on specific sections of code
        - Organize snippets from various client projects with tags
