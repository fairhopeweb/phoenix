        - Save code from the web and then auto-complete it in your IDE a few seconds later
        - Replace your code snippet bookmarks in your browser (plus, they’re searchable)
        - Save boilerplate code or have it saved automatically for you with auto-save
        - Save alternative algorithms or pseudocode that isn’t ready for production
        - Save code when resolving merge conflicts, just in case

        ![](/assets/graphics/use-cases/use_cases_general.png)

        - Save interesting snippets of code instead of starring or forking the entire repo for just a few lines
        - Save resources and lightweight libraries that help you solve problems without large overhead or third-party
        dependencies
        - Auto-complete READMEs, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT with standardized information within and across projects
        - Temporarily save code you’ll need to move soon
        - Save screenshots from multiple repos and compare them back-to-back to find errors where git pulls/merges/PRs
        have been improperly managed on specific sections of code
        - Organize snippets from various client projects with tags

                > I save a lot of my responses that are not available on the web. Specifically any sort of command I would use with GCloud, as well as little templates of code, like my try catches— I’ll actually just right-click, send to Pieces and autocomplete that into IntelliJ, VS Code, or any one of my editors.

                > Pieces code auto-complete is pretty useful on some of the boilerplate code that I use in a lot of my C++ and CMake projects. I copy certain things a lot and there's not really a good way to abstract it out, so, Pieces auto-completed it and nearly took care of everything for me.
