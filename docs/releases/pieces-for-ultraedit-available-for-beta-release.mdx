<p>Today&#x27;s a big day at Pieces as we&#x27;re excited to beta release the <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app/ue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pieces for UltraEdit integration</a>! This is a landmark for us as this is the first integration on top of the Pieces app built entirely by a third-party developer - in this case, our friends and partners at <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/ultraedit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UltraEdit</a>.</p><h2 id="f298m">Here&#x27;s how to get started:</h2><ul><li>Download UltraEdit 28</li><li><a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Pieces</a> if it&#x27;s not already running on your machine</li></ul><p>That&#x27;s it! UltraEdit will automatically detect Pieces and activate key features in UltraEdit.</p><h2 id="2c303">So what does the Pieces for UltraEdit integration do?</h2><p>When the integration is active, you&#x27;ll find a right-click context menu for Pieces inside UltraEdit that packs a lot of punch:</p><ul><li>Right-click (or hit CTRL-P twice) to save highlighted code or entire files to Pieces without leaving UltraEdit</li><li>Right-click to insert snippets you&#x27;ve previously saved to Pieces. You&#x27;ll find all your snippets auto-organized by language.</li></ul><p>The best part? You don&#x27;t have to even have Pieces open to perform these actions. Stay in your flow, and save/retrieve just what you want without leaving UltraEdit.</p><p>And rest assured - all your snippets are saved in the dedicated Pieces app if you want to the full experience of searching, renaming, recategorizing and more.</p><h2 id="d0aml">What&#x27;s up next on the Pieces for UltraEdit product roadmap?</h2><ul><li>Back up individual or all your pieces to the cloud</li><li>Sharing a piece with colleagues</li></ul><h2 id="10qaj">Send us feedback!</h2><p>Pieces for UltraEdit is free through the end of the year.
