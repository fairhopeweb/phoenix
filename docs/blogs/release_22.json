When the parent widget wants to lay out on the screen, it checks if it has any children. If it does, then it passes its constraints to its children and asks them how big/small they want to be. The child widget may repeat this process if it has children of its own.</p><p id=\"\">Once the Parent gets the sizes for each of its child widgets, it then checks those sizes against its own constraints.
