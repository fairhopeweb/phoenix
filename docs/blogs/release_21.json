Bulma was created by Jeremy Thomas, and an MIT license is used to license the Bulma source code. In this article, we’ll compare Bulma vs Bootstrap.</p><h2 id=\"49fpi\">Bulma vs Bootstrap: Features</h2><h3 id=\"3vjvf\">Bootstrap</h3><ul><li>Design templates for buttons, navigation, and other elements that are based on HTML and CSS</li><li>Reusable code with CSS classes</li><li>Modularity for modifying or eliminating certain components or component colors</li><li>Components made using JavaScript out of the box that have extra functionality like tooltips, modal windows, etc.</li></ul><h3 id=\"c1btr\">Bulma CSS</h3><ul><li>Every component of Bulma is designed with mobile devices in mind and is optimized for vertical reading</li><ul><li>Vertically stacked columns</li><li>The nav menu is hidden</li><li>The level component displays its children stacked vertically. However, by adding the is-mobile property, you can make sure that both columns or levels are laid down horizontally.</li></ul><li>Modularity: You can import each of the 39 .sass files that make up Bulma separately</li><li>Flexbox-powered columns</li></ul><h2 id=\"6qhsj\">Pros and Cons of Bootstrap vs Bulma</h2><h3 id=\"5hqvl\">Bootstrap</h3><p>Let’s have a look at some advantages of Bootstrap:</p><ul><li>Simple to use: Anyone can start using Bootstrap with just a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.</li><li>Responsive Features: The responsive CSS in Bootstrap adapts to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.</li><li>Mobile-first strategy: Mobile-first styles are a core component of Bootstrap 3&#x27;s framework.</li><li>Easy to modify: You can do anything with the code because it’s completely open-source, and knowledgeable users can significantly alter the framework.</li><li>Utilizes a grid: Developers can much more easily control where pieces appear on their sites thanks to the grid concept.</li><li>Widely compatible: Nearly all current browsers are compatible with Bootstrap (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, and Opera).</li></ul><p>Anything with benefits must also have some drawbacks. Let&#x27;s examine some of Bootstrap&#x27;s cons:</p><ul><li>You must be familiar with coding to use it. You probably won&#x27;t be able to use Bootstrap if you’re a true beginner. A CMS like WordPress is a better option for non-programmers.</li><li>You might depend on it excessively. If you become dependent on it, you&#x27;ll never learn how to create a website from scratch (although you may never need to).</li><li>It might not be as efficient as you would like. Bootstrap has a reputation for being big since it contains everything you could possibly need. It’s not ideal for building modest, straightforward websites.</li><li>Its naming convention can be perplexing. You must invest the time up front to become familiar with Bootstrap&#x27;s features. Because there is no way to intuit what is present or what it is named, it may necessitate extensive documentation.</li></ul><h3 id=\"9i48c\">Bulma CSS</h3><p>Let’s list some of the advantages of Bulma CSS:</p><ul><li>Free and open source</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>Customizable</li><li>Platform-independent</li><li>Simple to use and learn</li><li>Compatible with the majority of current browsers</li><li>Mobile-first framework</li><li>Dependable documentation</li><li>Supports Font Awesome versions 4 and 5</li><li>Provides a number of ready-to-use parts</li><li>Installing JavaScript is not necessary because it offers a lot of helpful tools</li></ul><p>Cons of Bulma:</p><ul><li>Bulma is a CSS-only framework, unlike Bootstrap. It does not come with JavaScript or jQuery preinstalled. Writing a custom script is necessary in order to add some fundamental features to Bulma, such as a toggle, which needs JavaScript or jQuery.</li><li>Its documentation is generally less strong than Bootstrap’s.</li><li>It has comparatively little community support to Bootstrap.</li></ul><h2 id=\"3l2v5\">Similarities Between Bootstrap and Bulma CSS</h2><p>Bulma CSS and Bootstrap share some characteristics. Here’s what the two have in common:</p><ul><li>They are front-end frameworks</li><li>Both are based on Flexbox</li><li>They are highly responsive</li><li>Both are compatible with Font Awesome</li></ul><h2 id=\"1qgnc\">Comparison</h2><p>Here’s a brief comparison between the Bootstrap and Bulma CSS frameworks:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"Feature table of Bulma and Bootstrap.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e87930ac52c2_Screenshot2023-01-17at3_19_28PM_0fe344df8d15feaf3ba9b8890be06290_800.png\"></div></figure><p>Based on statistics from<a href=\"https://2021.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/css-frameworks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <u>stateofcss.com</u></a>, we can compare Bulma vs Bootstrap based on satisfaction, interest, usage, awareness, and experience over time.</p><h3 id=\"2jt6h\">Satisfaction</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A chart of the most satisfying CSS frameworks.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e83cc9ac5307_image2_8ca1e211a2a30e3253fdbf123d5c0d98_800.png\"></div></figure><p>Bulma tops Bootstrap with 54% satisfaction, compared to 41%. Bulma takes second place in the table above (light green), whereas Bootstrap comes in at 9th on the board (dark blue).</p><h3 id=\"5n6k1\">Interest</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A chart of the interest in the best CSS frameworks.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e8b0dbac5306_image4_2ac3d17852e036f0e5bed2802330e2a7_800.png\"></div></figure><p>Regarding Interest, Bulma again wins out over Bootstrap. Bulma is at 29%, while Bootstrap claims less than 16%.</p><h3 id=\"1tr8d\">Usage</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A chart that shows Bootstrap is used more than Bulma.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e88073ac5305_image3_e6f6bb32cec63e75d77f80c151fe1771_800.png\"></div></figure><p>As for usage, Bootstrap tops every other CSS framework, including Bulma. Bulma, however, isn’t too far behind with 5th position on the table.</p><h3 id=\"bb8h2\">Awareness of Bulma vs Bootstrap</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A chart that shows the general awareness of Bulma vs Bootstrap.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e88d7dac5304_image6_9d3291bb50b42c551159aa4aa4662723_800.png\"></div></figure><p>Again, Bootstrap takes precedence over Bulma. With 100% awareness, Bootstrap is well known in the CSS framework space.</p><h3 id=\"2ulqe\">Experience Over Time</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A table that shows how developers like Bootstrap over time.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e8d26bac529c_image5_ad1bc144b7caaee915b500f637da626a_800.png\"></div></figure><p>Based on survey respondents, Bootstrap lacks continuing interest in the community, with 39% not intending to use the framework, and 10% totally not interested in it as of 2021. However, in comparison to Bulma, Bootstrap may be better off.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A table that shows declining interest in Bulma.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63cabbfa87d9e85793ac52ae_image1_9e3855d444eebd24bfd0259d58906ac9_800.png\"></div></figure><p>The rate at which people say they would use Bulma seems very low with only 8.1%, which is nearly the same as its interest rate in 2021— 10.6%.</p><h2 id=\"5do7\">Bulma vs Bootstrap: Wrapping Up</h2><p>Directly comparing Bulma vs Bootstrap, Bulma is a good option if you need to rapidly construct a user interface and are looking for predefined interfaces and components.</p><p>Although there isn&#x27;t really a right or wrong CSS framework, in general, Bulma is easier for a newbie developer to learn because of its simplicity and readability. In addition to Bootstrap and Bulma, you can choose any CSS framework based on the needs of your application.</p>\n\n    <figure data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\">\n        <!-- strchf script -->\n<script>\n        if(window.strchfSettings === undefined) window.strchfSettings = {};\n    window.strchfSettings.stats = {url: \"https://pieces-app.storychief.io/en/bootstrap-bulma?id=1359829121&type=26\",title: \"Bulma vs Bootstrap: How Do They Compare?\",id: \"f48cd0d8-d254-4e17-a18e-3d20939412eb\"};\n            (function(d, s, id) {\n      var js, sjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n      if (d.getElementById(id)) {window.strchf.update(); return;}\n      js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n      js.src = \"https://d37oebn0w9ir6a.cloudfront.net/scripts/v0/strchf.js\";\n      js.async = true;\n      sjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sjs);\n    }(document, 'script', 'storychief-jssdk'))\n    </script>\n<!-- End strchf script -->    </figure>\n",
