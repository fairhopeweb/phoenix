  "Post summary": "Infrastructure engineer Akshita saves useful snippets, extracts text from code screenshots, and more with Pieces for Developers. ",
  "FullPost": "<p>When infrastructure engineer Akshita made the transition from student to employee, Pieces was right there with her.</p><p>“I would say OCR is the most important feature for students,” she says, when recounting the tedious process of retyping code from tutorials, slides or textbooks. As a full-fledged developer now, Akshita still watches a lot of YouTube videos and receives screenshots of code from StackOverflow, so she continues to find the code extraction feature in Pieces invaluable.</p><p>“When I started my full-time role, I had to completely start from scratch on learning Dart; I learned by watching a lot of videos, and if I wanted to save something, I would take a screenshot of the main operators and then save them in Pieces for reference. I don't have to Google it again and again.”</p><p>Akshita saved most of her snippets for that same reason— it’s way easier to find and reference a snippet that she’s saved to Pieces than on the web. “I saved a Pub/Sub snippet when I was working on a data ingestion project because it's a lot of repeated code that I need to use. &nbsp;It was being used in multiple places and I had to rewrite that code again and again. I still use that snippet whenever I need to make a new analytics model for the machine learning team; I just take that snippet, add it to my code and change the parameters.”</p>",
