  "Post summary": "It's time to get rid of that cluttered bookmarks folder on your browser! Bookmark code no more with Pieces for Developers.",
  "FullPost": "<p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">üí° Trying to bookmark code in your browser is pretty painful when you want to find and revisit that solution later. An easy hack is to save code with </em><a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/install\" target=\"_blank\"><em id=\"\">Pieces for Developers</em></a><em id=\"\">, which automatically attaches the source URL from where you grabbed the snippet. &nbsp;You can not only find the snippet easily later, but you can hop out to the page it came from to remind yourself about the broader context.</em></p><p id=\"\">I‚Äôm sure most of you search Google to find solutions for errors, from how to sort a list to a breadth-first binary tree traversal to how to establish a database connection.</p><p id=\"\">Chances are, you bookmark code solutions from some StackOverflow page, thinking it‚Äôs saved for the future.</p><p id=\"\">But revisiting that solution in your bookmarks folder is suboptimal for a bunch of reasons:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>Unstructured bookmark lists are hard to search, and you have no idea where to start looking for the solution.</li><li>Maybe you spend a bunch of effort organizing bookmarks, but most of us don‚Äôt have time.</li><li>A bookmark provides minimal information unless you click through each link.</li><li>Bookmarks save no context for your problem, which is often how you might want to search.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Fear not - let‚Äôs look at a simple, free bookmarking tool (and WAY more), Pieces for Developers. It‚Äôs much more effective at managing your saved links and solutions.</p><p id=\"\">A much more effective way to bookmark code</p><p id=\"\">You might know Pieces for Developers as a snippet tool where you can save code and easily find, reuse, or reference it later. One of the more interesting ways I use Pieces is through the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome extension</a>, which enables me to save code from any webpage with one click.</p><p id=\"\">The most killer feature of the Pieces for Chrome extension, though, is Related Links. This makes it far more useful as a home for your URLs. &nbsp;When you save a snippet from a web page using the extension, Pieces automatically saves the URL of the page the snippet came from.</p><p id=\"\">So when you need that snippet, you can search in Pieces using exact or fuzzy match based on the snippet or the language, and you‚Äôll also find a link to the URL that you originally got the snippet from. THAT is incredibly helpful to refresh on the context around the snippet. Way more helpful than a quickly bookmarked code snippet!</p><h2 id=\"crfjs\">Let‚Äôs look at some examples in the wild...</h2><h3 id=\"3snti\">Finding Shell Commands</h3><p id=\"\">If you‚Äôve ever tried bookmarking your dev shell commands, you know it‚Äôs much easier to just search for them again than find them in your bookmarks list.</p><h4 id=\"\">Finding Shell Commands without Pieces:</h4><ol id=\"\"><li>Open your bookmarks</li><li>Try to remember what the page was</li><li>Scroll through an endless list </li><li>Finally find the link and navigate to it<strong id=\"\">‚Äç‚Äç</strong></li></ol><h4 id=\"\">Finding Shell Commands with Pieces:</h4><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/620c45471fdc383c72190874_final_61f97c65a9ff2c012a7c5964_686295.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\" alt=\"Searching for a shell command in Pieces.\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">1.

Maybe you‚Äôve tried bookmarking commands to merge your local branch, fetch, rebase, or resolve conflicts for your ease, but forgot your way back.</p><p id=\"\">If you‚Äôd saved those commands in Pieces for Developers, you can get right back to your page in no time using the Related Links feature.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/620c431f04fa7d19672776c3_Searchingforthecommandinanever-endinglist1_6263c8b73c598ce26b856c5518389b28.gif\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Git Commands before Pieces (left) and Git Commands after Pieces (right)</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">‚Äç</p><h3 id=\"bea3r\">Frontend Development</h3><p id=\"\">While working with CSS, you might get confused about when to use an inline, block, or inline-block display for controlling the layout of an element. Scrolling through a never-ending list of code bookmarks to find their correct usage on W3Schools is a nightmare, isn‚Äôt it? Instead, you can simply save a snippet in Pieces and jump to the relevant pages to understand their use cases. Don‚Äôt bookmark code; find the right snippet and use it in no time.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">üí°Along with saving the links to pages, Pieces also helps you save specific information about them.</strong> So if you‚Äôve some code that you feel like revisiting, rather than bookmarking the page, try saving it with Pieces for Developers. You‚Äôll save a lot more time looking for it later!<br></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/620c431fd2dfef32c4ce74ec_final_61f7f47acf909a00aea1bb46_186057_d5c5d536f18e4d2a7c918d0f41db662e.gif\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Upgrade Your Ability to Bookmark Code with Pieces - It‚Äôs Totally Free<br></h2><p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://pieces.app/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">You can install Pieces for free</a> to save all your important information where it's organized and easily accessible.
