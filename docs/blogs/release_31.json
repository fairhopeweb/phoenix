  "FullPost": "<p>Selecting a color is an important aspect of website design. It goes beyond just using your favorite colors, and requires you to choose the ones that best suit your target audience. This is why it’s essential to understand colors, their properties and the different relationships between them. Knowing best practices and tools for color design will help you to create compelling websites.</p><h2 id=\"6scn1\">What is Color?</h2><p>Color is recognized through the reflection of light from objects. The eyes see color when any object reflects light. It has three main aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Hue</strong>: Another name for color, and represents the base color, such as yellow, red or blue</li><li><strong>Value</strong>: The lightness or darkness of a hue</li><li><strong>Intensity</strong>: How bright or dull a hue is</li></ul><h2 id=\"f7teq\">What is the Role of Color in User Interface Designs?</h2><ul><li>It influences people&#x27;s perception of your website designs.</li><li>It builds brand recognition.</li><li>It makes browsing your website more appealing.</li><li>It draws attention to certain elements of web pages.</li><li>It gives meaning to designs.</li></ul><h3 id=\"534n0\">Color Theory</h3><p>Colors are significant in user interface design and represent the content of your website. Unfortunately, colors that distract and feel unnatural can make designs appear messy. Color theory is the application of art and science that helps to combine colors properly. </p><h2 id=\"48udt\">Understanding Colors</h2><p>It’s crucial to understand colors and how to use them in your user interface designs. The different categories of colors include the following:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Primary</strong>: The base colors from which other colors are derived. They include yellow, blue, and red.</li><li><strong>Secondary</strong>: Combinations of primary colors. They include orange, green, and purple.</li><li><strong>Tertiary</strong>:<strong> </strong>Combinations of primary and secondary colors. For example, tertiary colors include magenta (red+purple) and violet (blue+purple).</li></ol><h3 id=\"d04kc\">Isolation Effect</h3><p>The isolation effect is the standard for all designs and gives impact, making an element of your design stand out. For example, isolation effects make it easier for people to recognize your website. Brands make this possible by combining colors that match their designs&#x27; different sections.</p><h3 id=\"9rndh\">Color Psychology</h3><p>Colors have different meanings, and it’s ideal to use the ones that match the concept of your design. Below are commonly accepted feelings associated with each color:</p><p><strong>Red: </strong>Boldness, power, excitement, strength, passion, desire</p><p><strong>Green: </strong>Harmony, life, nature, health, balance, freshness</p><p><strong>Blue: </strong>Professionalism, patience, peace, trustworthiness, stability, honor</p><p><strong>Brown: </strong>Confidence, comfort, relaxation, durability, reliability, honesty</p><p><strong>Yellow: </strong>Cheerfulness, brightness<strong>, </strong>energy, liveliness, happiness, intelligence, fun, warmth</p><p><strong>Purple: </strong>Nobility, royalty, wealth, luxury, wisdom, mystery</p><p><strong>Black: </strong>Sophistication, seriousness, elegance</p><p><strong>Orange: </strong>Friendliness, creativity, courage, youthfulness, adventure</p><p><strong>Pink: </strong>Affection, romance, peace, care</p><p><strong>White: </strong>Purity, innocence, simplicity</p><h3 id=\"f182a\">Color Relationships</h3><p>Color relationships allow you to choose colors that relate to one another in a unique way. The color wheel shows the relationships between colors. Below is an image of the <u><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canva color wheel</a></u> followed by explanations of the different color relationships you can use.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"The color wheel with blue selected.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63459c6449a3a948ceca7575_image5_614821a3ce09369ae096e55a7a405498_800.png\"></div></figure><p><strong>Monochromatic Relationship:</strong> This involves using one color with different variations of that color, such as shades of blue, shades of green, etc. Monochromatic colors look sophisticated in designs, but the contrast can be minimal, which can make it difficult for specific design elements to stand out. However, you can avoid this by intentionally making your design elements more visible – for example, using bright colors for the text.</p><p>Below is an example of a monochromatic relationship.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A green-on-green monochromatic landing page.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63459c6249a3a90521ca7572_image1_11322c6176d6627ba670dd546615d5f5_800.png\"></div></figure><p><strong>Complementary Relationship: </strong>This uses a pair of colors that lie directly across from each other on the color wheel. Examples include green and red, blue and orange and yellow and purple. The high contrast between complementary colors makes your design bright and noticeable.</p><p>It’s ideal to use complementary colors when you want to draw attention to or emphasize certain elements of your designs. However, mobile application designers should avoid using too many complementary colors because their bold contrast can exhaust the eyes quickly.</p><p><strong>Triadic Relationship: </strong>This uses three colors by picking the colors to the right and left of the base color in the color wheel. The three colors are equal distances from each other on the wheel, forming a triangle shape. Examples of triadic color relationships include purple/green/orange, yellow/blue/red and blue-purple/red-orange/yellow-green.</p><p>Triadic colors create a balanced and harmonious relationship. It’s ideal to use triadic colors when you want to make something appear intriguing.</p><p>Below is an example of a triadic color relationship:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A triadic landing page.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63459c6249a3a96fbcca7573_image4_93fe84824aad6d2e94e8f443d5c2f93d_800.png\"></div></figure><p><strong>Analogous Relationship: </strong>This choice involves using a group of two or more colors next to each other on the color wheel—for example, red-orange/orange/red or yellow/yellow-green/green. There is mild contrast with this relationship.</p><p>Below is an example of an analogous color relationship:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"An analogous landing page.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63459c6249a3a934aaca7574_image2_b800e3c4075a718a5d94ffe4537f376b_800.png\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"dlggg\">Tips on Color Usage for Your Web Designs</h2><p>These are general rules of thumb in color usage for creating exceptional designs, and can depend on individual preference:</p><ul><li>First, when choosing colors for your designs, decide on the desired color relationship.</li><li>To have a clear and clean design, use a single base color.</li><li>To draw attention to a design, use a color that stands out.</li><li>Avoid using one color for your website.</li><li>Avoid using black for your designs— black can feel unnatural.</li><li>Be intentional about the colors you choose.
