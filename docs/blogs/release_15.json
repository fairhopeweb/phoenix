  "FullPost": "<p id=\"\">There are many clipboard managers available, but only a few of them have been designed specifically for software and web developers. If you are a developer who wants to improve your productivity, you must adopt an advanced clipboard apps.</p><p id=\"\">Both Windows and macOS come with a basic, limited clipboard, which means that you can copy something and then paste it. End users’ needs have evolved in recent years, leading to the creation of more advanced clipboard managers. Not all of these options have been designed with software development in mind, though.</p><p id=\"\">If you have ever felt slowed down by your operating system’s basic clipboard, it is time to try a more powerful app. This article will present the five best clipboard apps for developer productivity, as well as what criteria were used to select them.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why You Should Adopt a Clipboard App</h2><p id=\"\">As a developer, increasing your productivity should be one of your top priorities. The best clipboard managers offer three ways for you to do that:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Store more than one thing</strong>: With clipboard apps, you can keep a history of all the items you’ve copied.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Search through your copied items</strong>: Clipboard managers allow you to easily retrieve the item you want to paste.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reuse code snippets</strong>: You can copy all the code snippets you need at once and then paste them only if you need to.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Elements of a Good Clipboard App </h2><p id=\"\">There are specific features to consider when evaluating a clipboard app for developers. The following elements were used to select and rate the top five clipboard managers:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Integration with IDEs and text editors</strong>: Developers spend most of their time writing code. For a clipboard app to enhance your productivity, it needs to be directly integrated into <a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/blog/picking-the-best-ide-for-web-development\" target=\"_blank\">your favorite IDE</a>.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cloud support</strong>: The clipboard app should allow you to save your copied items to the cloud so you can access them anywhere, regardless of the device you are using. For security reasons, the app should be able to encrypt the info during upload.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Custom keyboard shortcuts:</strong> Developers heavily use <a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/blog/keyboard-shortcuts-programmers\">hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts</a>, and they want the ability to define the shortcuts as needed.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Multi-format support</strong>: Copying is not always about text. The clipboard manager should also allow you to store multimedia items, such as images, videos, or tables.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Item organization</strong>: When many items are stored in one place, the storage location can easily become a mess. The manager app should include a clipboard organization system allowing you to organize your copied items or give you the option to quickly find the one you need.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Top Five Best Clipboard App Managers</h2><p id=\"\">The following clipboard manager apps meet the required criteria, so they’ll help you improve your developer productivity as you write software.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 1. Pieces</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6238beb2fa9ea174d722ac0b_1*E9HPoSCwSuaECzLIFq3q5g.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://pieces.app/\" target=\"_blank\">Pieces</a>, which offers free or paid options, is an AI-powered clipboard app designed specifically for developers and supports both macOS and Windows. It also supports the most popular IDEs and text editors with custom <a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/plugins\" target=\"_blank\">IDE&nbsp;plugins</a>. </p><p id=\"\">Pieces allows you to save, reuse, and share many data type format items, including code snippets, links, text, screenshots, and images. Each clipping will be automatically stored in the cloud so that you can access it from multiple devices.</p><p id=\"\">When you need to look for a clipping, you can use its lightning-fast <a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-desktop-app-os-global-search\">global search feature</a> to instantly retrieve any item you previously copied. This is especially effective because Pieces automatically captures any possible metadata related to a snippet so that you can more easily find it later.</p><p id=\"\">Pieces is based on a lightweight UI to keep you focused while you are working, and it supports several intuitive keyboard shortcuts. It also allows you to configure your own hotkeys.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 2. Flycut</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6238beb291a06b6fa284ef0d_1*AITpnR3zOqVOVBjRtQUg8g.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Flycut</a> is a clean, simple, and free <a href=\"https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">open source</a> clipboard app for macOS and iOS that is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/snark/jumpcut\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Jumpcut</a>, a minimal clipboard manager for macOS. Flycut was designed with developers in mind, and its main focus is on code snippets. For this reason, it comes with many hot keys and keyboard shortcuts, which can be customized according to your needs in the preferences panel.</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, Flycut allows you to store only text snippets. This means that images, videos, and tables are currently not supported. It also neither supports Windows nor offers specific integrations for the most common IDEs and text editors.</p><p id=\"\">Although Flycut does not come with cloud features natively, you can configure it to sync with your Dropbox account. This way, you can store your clipboard history in an external cloud service and then access it from wherever you want.</p><p id=\"\">When Flycut is launched, its icon appears in your menu bar. Every time you copy a text snippet, Flycut stores it in history for you. Using `Shift + Command + V`, you can access the history and navigate with the right or left arrows to select the item to paste.

Notably, it has an incredible amount of options available and is highly configurable and customizable. With Ditto, you can also create groups and organize your copied items as you like. You can also search through the items to easily find the one you need.</p><p id=\"\">Ditto is a general-purpose application that was not built explicitly for developers, so it should not surprise you that there are no official plug-ins for the main IDEs on the market.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Pastebot</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6238beb28b47d81068c4b6d1_1*83XzPenJQhvl_WK76a3aAw.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://tapbots.com/pastebot/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pastebot</a> is a license-based clipboard manager for macOS and iOS only.

Paste</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6238beb2c2d9ea688d1b1824_1*cseJSlq0klv9YMQYLdS7HA.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/paste-clipboard-manager/id967805235\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Paste</a> is a subscription-based clipboard manager that allows you to store everything you copy on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad.
