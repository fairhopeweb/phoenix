  "FullPost": "<p id=\"\">On your Mac, you can access one of the simplest yet most extraordinary inventions in the history of personal computers: your clipboard. Just imagine how much time this simple tool saves you every day! Wouldn’t it be painful to manually duplicate all your work without this functionality?</p><p id=\"\">This is especially important if you’re a developer, as there are plenty of scenarios where you need to use your clipboard:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>Copy-paste code snippets from Stack Overflow</li><li>Move your code between files</li><li>Copy and share code snippets with your colleagues</li></ul><p id=\"\">Despite being an effortless tool to use, your Mac clipboard history also comes with a lot of limitations. These limitations may be slowing down your productivity as a developer. This article will show you how <a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/install\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pieces for Developers</a> can revolutionize your clipboard, a tool you didn’t know could get any better.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why is Your Mac Clipboard History Limited?</h2><p id=\"\">To access your Mac clipboard functionality, use <strong id=\"\">⌘ + C</strong> to copy, then <strong id=\"\">⌘ + V</strong> to paste.</p><p id=\"\">This may be enough for a variety of situations, but it can also be pretty limiting to your productivity. The limitations of the functionality become very evident when you need to paste something you copied an hour ago, but you’ve already overwritten that piece of text by copying something else. Now there’s no way for you to retrieve it. Then you end up going back to find what you initially saved and copying it all over again.</p><p id=\"\">You can access the text you’ve saved on your Mac clipboard; however, the usefulness of this history is limited. The list only contains only the most recent text you copied. This is how to see your clipboard history on your Mac: </p><ol id=\"\"><li>Select the Edit menu of your Finder</li><li>Then click Show Clipboard</li></ol><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"Accessing your Mac’s clipboard history\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62829c5004ce34ba754f4d1d_1*5hU3cAn2e6N3DTyva9iDVw.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Accessing your Mac’s clipboard history</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">What you’ll see is a simple text file showing only the last thing you copied.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"Clipboard history popup on a Mac\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62829c5008eb940d0199b3ff_1*YGPW3Cehr-bSBoleEl8Yeg.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">An example of my clipboard history</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Once you realize how limiting your Mac’s clipboard history can be, you may feel the need for a better solution. One that will allow you to manage everything you’ve copied in an organized way and not worry about overwriting your saves.</p><p id=\"\">There’s an answer to these performance issues— use a <strong id=\"\">clipboard manager</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"\">What is a Clipboard Manager?</h2><p id=\"\">As a software developer, you’re always copy-pasting snippets of code from various sources. How many snippets of code have you copied from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Stack Overflow</a> or <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">CodePen</a>? How many blocks of code do you move from one place to another every single day? How many lines of code do you share with your peers to solve your project challenges?</p><p id=\"\">A Mac clipboard manager is simply a tool to power up all your copy-pasting in a safe, efficient way.</p><p id=\"\">Imagine you copied an important code snippet from Stack Overflow and overwrote it accidentally. Suppose you want to save a block of code and use it again in an hour without having to worry about where you can store it.</p><p id=\"\">Your clipboard manager has you covered. These tools allow you to store, organize, and view your recently copied items, and then use them whenever you need them.</p><h2 id=\"\">Pieces for Developers</h2><p id=\"\">As a developer, you’ll want to use a clipboard manager that is specifically designed to support your work with code. That’s where <a href=\"https://code.pieces.app/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pieces for Developers</a> shines.

You’ll see which website your snippet came from, which language it uses, which tags it has, who else has worked on it, and more, so it’ll be easier for you to find it later and reuse it whenever you need.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Now you see how much better your Mac clipboard history can be!

With these add-ons, you’ll be able to save your snippets to Pieces for Developers directly from your favorite code editor.</p><p id=\"\">For example, when using Pieces for VS Code, once you decide to save a snippet, you just need to highlight it and then press ⇧+⌘ + V on your Mac to see your snippet appear directly in Pieces for Developers.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/641b3c187817d6470779d895_COPY_PASTE_NEW_SNIPPET.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Copying and pasting a new snippet to Pieces for Developers.\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">3. After this step, this is what all the snippets you saved will look like.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/641b3bb18404e631f8c494df_Screenshot%202023-03-22%20at%201.32.20%20PM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The view of snippets in Pieces for Developers.\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">4.
