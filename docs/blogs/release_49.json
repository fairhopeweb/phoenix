  "Post summary": "In the months Karam has used Pieces, he's discovered a multitude of ways to use it, including overcoming errors and implementing found solutions. ",
  "FullPost": "<p id=\"\">Though Karam started using Pieces only a few months ago, the ways he uses it continuously evolve. “When I was new to Pieces, I was also new to coding. The work I was doing was always foreign; It felt like every time I wrote code, it was the first time I wrote it. I didn’t have anything to reuse ever because everything was a new frontier. As a young developer, but also as a fast case developer, I'm not doing the same thing over and over again. So, I've used Pieces in different workflows.”</p><p id=\"\">One new way that Karam uses Pieces is to help overcome errors. “I have to run a certain command every time I start a new project in Flutter, and so I saved the one liner into Pieces. In the description, I describe the problem it solves. I also pasted in the exact error I get. So if I ever get that error, I can search the error and Pieces will return the solution.”</p><p id=\"\">And, Pieces helps Karam reduce the time it takes to implement the solutions he finds online. “The last piece I saved was a terminal command. I was trying to fix my CocoaPods, and I couldn't solve this issue for like half an hour. One thing I kept doing over and over again was uninstalling CocoaPods, but there are like eight different CocoaPod pieces to install separately. Then, I came across one guy's snippet on Stack Overflow, which was a one-line terminal command that searches all of your files that have CocoaPods and then deletes CocoaPods automatically. It saved me eight lines of copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.”</p>",
