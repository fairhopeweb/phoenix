  "Post summary": "Anushka has seriously simplified her workflow by saving obscure Git commands, among other useful code snippets, in Pieces. ",
  "FullPost": "<p>Anushka Gupta shines as a developer advocate at Pieces, where she uses her wide knowledge base to create content that educates, engages and helps developers; collaborates with marketing, design and engineering teams; provides technical review for all of our external content and more.</p><p>When she’s coding herself, she uses Pieces to save helpful snippets, whether she reaches for them every day or once in a blue moon.</p><p>One recent snippet that she saved to Pieces simplifies her personal workflow to make it easier for her to work with a team of developers. “Usually when I'm writing code, I break [a task] down into, like, hundreds of commits. Then, whenever I have to add a code review, I have to merge all of them into a single commit and then push it. This Git command combines all of your commits into one for a PR.”</p><p>Simply storing the command in Pieces has shaved time off of her workflow. “This isn’t a very common Git command and I never remember it, so I had to save the question on Stack Overflow about how this command works and revisit that browser page whenever I wanted to squash my commits or open a code review. I’ve been using this particular snippet for over a year, and I had to dig it up every single time. Now with Pieces, I just save that particular snippet in my Pieces repo and I can get it directly from there whenever I want to I want to open a code review or PR.”</p><p>Anushka has a story like this about nearly every snippet in her repository. Reducing the time she spends searching for snippets and re-reading how they work has sped up her coding workflow and allows her to keep making a difference at Pieces.</p>",
