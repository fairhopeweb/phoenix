  "FullPost": "<h2 id=\"\">TL;DR</h2><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Snippets are small chunks of code that developers save because they might want to use them later. Snippets are useful throughout your workflow as a developer, from researching to developing to collaborating. But many devs don‚Äôt use snippets because it‚Äôs a hassle to save them. </em><a href=\"http://pieces.app/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Pieces</em></a><em id=\"\"> allows you to save snippets in less than a second from your IDE or Chrome. Best of all, the snippets are auto-formatted and auto-tagged by language and structure for easily finding and re-using later.

Open source code, boilerplate code, analytics tags, SQL queries, loops, algorithms, logging and validation and so much more.</p><p id=\"\">Think about how much of this sort of code that you likely write and re-write over and over again. Or how much time you waste trying to find that old snippet in that other project somewhere that will save you time.</p><p id=\"\">So much code that we write as developers is ripe for re-use.
