They might come from Twitter threads, YouTube tutorials, or even university lectures. <a href=\"http://codefromscreenshot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codefromscreenshot.com</a> is an easy-to-use tool that lets you copy code from a screenshot.</p><p id=\"\">Because it instantly extracts code from screenshots, it helps save valuable time and energy that would otherwise be wasted on retyping code from these screenshots. Uploading a screenshot here delivers copyable code that can be used in my IDE right away. It saves me a lot of time and allows me to focus on more important things, like development and bug fixing.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62963372ccd50d3cb46b5aef_codefromscreenshot.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\" alt=\"CodeFromScreenshot in action. \"></div><figcaption id=\"\">CodefromScreenshot (Image from author)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"\">WakaTime</h2><p id=\"\">In the age of remote work, keeping track of your time as a developer is essential.

I use it to beautify screenshots that I share with my team, but it would also be useful for screenshots that you share on social media.
