Currently, nearly every programming team in the professional world is using Git, and there is really almost no serious challenger out there especially with code hosting services like Github, Bitbucket, and Gitlab causing even further adoption.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, I will explain some of the commands I use every day in Git to allow me to stay productive while managing my own code. Hopefully, after this, you will be able to come away with some helpful commands and have some you even want to save!</p><h2 id=\"\">Resetting</h2><p id=\"\">The <em id=\"\">git reset</em> command is used to reset the <em id=\"\">HEAD</em> to a specific state.

Things get complicated when you rewrite the server Git history, as your unique source of truth (the server) is no longer the right source to follow.I like using <em id=\"\">reset --hard</em> when I want to restart from another branch’s state. For instance, I typically use it when I want to rewrite a Git history of a working copy.</p><p id=\"\">I reset my local branch to the state where it was initially, and then I better organize the working copy by getting the commits from the server one by one in an order that best suits.</p><h3 id=\"\">Soft</h3><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1040px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1040px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62d0f64da039f9d09f3b97bd_raycast-untitled%20(8)-min.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"A git reset command.\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://user-3863d558-45a9-40e6-9dff-136019435fd6-fhcmbheklq-uc.a.run.app/?p=a57440b27c\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Save to Pieces</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">On the other hand, the <em id=\"\">reset --soft</em> command is less destructive, as it will rewrite the Git history, but all the changes of each commit you reset will come back to you.</p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">reset --soft</em> is very handy when you’ve shipped one or multiple commits, but you realize that you want to restructure the way the commits are organized, as it allows you to <strong id=\"\">reset</strong> to the starting point before you committed your changes.</p><h2 id=\"\">Amending</h2><p id=\"\">Enhance your <em id=\"\">git commit</em> usage:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1040px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1040px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62d0f68f68ea161a182346d1_raycast-untitled%20(9)-min.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"A command to amend a git commit.\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><a href=\"https://user-3863d558-45a9-40e6-9dff-136019435fd6-fhcmbheklq-uc.a.run.app/?p=235645aa1a\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Save to Pieces</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Amending has a secret power.

Be careful when using it!</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">A small note</strong> on the <em id=\"\">--force</em> option: I tend to use <em id=\"\">--force-with-lease </em>more often, as it will protect you against a potential situation wherein someone pushes a commit while you rebase.
