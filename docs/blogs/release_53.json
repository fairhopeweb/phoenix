A thing of the past.</h4><h4 id=\"e2u2p\"><strong>tl:dr</strong></h4><p>Developers take a ton of screenshots of code which often live on their desktop or in some Finder tray. &nbsp;These screenshots are usually impossible to search and the code in the image isn’t accessible. But with the Pieces snippet saving tool, images can now be converted into text so that the code inside the screenshots can be copied, pasted, and edited in your IDE.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div><img alt=\"Magician transforming a screenshot into text\" src=\"https://images.storychief.com/account_32099/Untitleddesign_9041f1386ab45f0ce42be1f8de5ab447_800.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h4 id=\"7t26r\">Drowning in screenshots?</h4><p>✋<strong>Raise your hand if you’ve experienced these screenshot frustrations:</strong></p><ul><li>You face an issue while coding.
