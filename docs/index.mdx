From students and indie developers, to startups and open source teams, to enterprise organizations and beyond,
Pieces for Developers is purpose built as a cohesive layer and a "tool between tools" that boosts productivity
around code snippets in three major workflow processes: researching and problem-solving in the browser,
collaborating with colleagues, and lastly, writing, reviewing, referencing, reusing code in their IDE.

<Heading type={"h2"}>Save key materials from your developer workflow</Heading>

Pieces for Developers was built from the ground up to serve as a centralized place to save all types of materials and resources related a developers work-in-progress journey.

Along the journey our users have saved things like Boilerplate/Reference snippets, Common Bash/Powershell Commands, CI/CD Configurations, HTTP Requests, Screenshots, Architecture/UML Diagrams, Text Notes, and so much more.
