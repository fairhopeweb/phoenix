# Snippet editing is live!
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

Throughout the last few weeks, we’ve received a ton of feedback and ideas from users, and we couldn’t be more appreciative. We’re listening intently and working hard to make Pieces indispensable to your workflow.
One of the most common requests (especially from our internal users!) is to be able to lightly edit a snippet saved in Pieces. <strong>Well, we’re happy to let you know that now you can!</strong>

## Pieces for Developers
**Get started for free <a href="http://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. For the best experience, please make sure both Pieces for Developers and Pieces OS are up-to-date.**

- Version 1.5.7 brings basic snippet editing, so you can adjust that character or align those spaces. To edit a snippet, just tap CMD/CTRL+E to toggle edit mode and CMD/CTRL+S to save If you need to cancel your edits, just tap ‘esc’ on your keyboard

- Adjusted “Add” Menu We moved the Add Menu out of the toolbar and closer to the carousel and improved it to help users learn all the ways to save a snippet.

- Also included in this release are many small bug fixes and performance improvements. As you navigate throughout the app, you’ll notice fixes related to theming, navigation, onboarding and more.
We look forward to hearing how you use editing and how we can continue to make the app even better!
