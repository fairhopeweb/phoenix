# Pieces for UltraEdit available for beta release
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

Today's a big day at Pieces as we're excited to beta release the <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app/ue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pieces for UltraEdit integration</a>! This is a landmark for us as this is the first integration on top of the Pieces app built entirely by a third-party developer - in this case, our friends and partners at <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/ultraedit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UltraEdit</a>.

## Here's how to get started:
- Download UltraEdit 28
- <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Pieces</a> if it's not already running on your machine

That's it! UltraEdit will automatically detect Pieces and activate key features in UltraEdit.

## So what does the Pieces for UltraEdit integration do?
When the integration is active, you'll find a right-click context menu for Pieces inside UltraEdit that packs a lot of punch:
- Right-click (or hit CTRL-P twice) to save highlighted code or entire files to Pieces without leaving UltraEdit
- Right-click to insert snippets you've previously saved to Pieces. You'll find all your snippets auto-organized by language.
The best part? You don't have to even have Pieces open to perform these actions. Stay in your flow, and save/retrieve just what you want without leaving UltraEdit.
And rest assured - all your snippets are saved in the dedicated Pieces app if you want to the full experience of searching, renaming, recategorizing and more.

## What's up next on the Pieces for UltraEdit product roadmap?
- Back up individual or all your pieces to the cloud
- Sharing a piece with colleagues

## Send us feedback!
Pieces for UltraEdit is free through the end of the year. Tell your friends and colleagues and share feedback anytime at support@pieces.app or hit [SHIFT + !] from inside the Pieces app.
