### Saving Snippets
- In addition to right-clicking or using keyboard shortcuts to save a snippet, users can now run the “Save to Pieces” command prompt.
### Viewing Snippets inside VS Code
- View your saved snippets inside VS Code via a Tree View in the sidebar! (You can always toggle to Pieces app for a more robust, dedicated snippet viewing and managing experience.)
- To preview the contents of a snippet, simply hover your cursor over the name of the snippet.
- Snippets in the VS Code Tree View are auto-organized by language
- Refresh the list of snippets in the Tree View by clicking on the “Refresh” button in the upper right-hand corner of the Tree View.
### Re-Using Snippets
- To insert a saved snippet, click on the desired snippet in the Tree View and it will be inserted into your cursor location in your editor
### Coming Soon: Auto-Complete Code in VS Code
- Pieces will suggest code completions right in VS Code from your saved snippets in Pieces. Not from public repos like other auto-complete tools - Pieces auto-completes from YOUR private Pieces repo. Your code never leaves your machine.
