title: Howdy World
description: Today's release is a massive upgrade for our VS Code users. Foremost is the release of Auto-Save, where the Pieces AI Assistant will intelligently save snippets on your behalf based on your workflow. We've also brought a lot of the core features of the Pieces Desktop app into VS Code, so you can keep your flow while saving and managing your snippets. Enjoy!
