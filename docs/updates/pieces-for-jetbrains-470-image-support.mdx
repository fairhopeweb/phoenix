# Pieces for JetBrains 4.7.0: Image Support 🖼️
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

We’re coming in hot with nearly a dozen improvements to your Pieces for JetBrains experience. From image support to compatibility with various IDE themes, no detail is too small! Let us know if there’s anything else we can do to make your experience even better <a href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

## Image Support
One of the most useful features of the Pieces for Developers Desktop App is extracting code from screenshots, thereby transforming images of code into editable, useful code. Those image-based snippets weren’t super useful in Pieces for JetBrains — until now.

With this release, you can view your code screenshots & images right within your JetBrains IDE, and easily copy the code extracted from those images, too.

## Bug Fixes and User Experience Improvements
Many small fixes add up to a vastly improved experience for you, our Pieces for JetBrains users. This release improves the display of several icons and logs, prevents text overfill in the Snippet Description field, and fixed a small bug in which the Save to Pieces As dialog wasn’t always suggesting descriptions. Keep an eye out for even more incremental improvements in our next release!
