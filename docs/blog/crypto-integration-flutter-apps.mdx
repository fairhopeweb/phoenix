title: Create a Crypto Integration in Your Flutter Apps
description: Forms are a major way to retrieve user data in most applications today. A form consists of many input fields together that take in a user‚Äôs response or request. Also, developers might want users to make certain decisions based on their interactions, and then save this data to a server. This form data can also be used later on in the application, thus calling for the creation of a more complex form that is referred to as a dynamic form.

## <strong Metamask**
Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to transact with the Ethereum blockchain. It‚Äôs simply your wallet available through their browser extensions and applications, which you can connect to sites that support payment via Metamask. It really is that simple, and that‚Äôs all you need to know for this article, but if you‚Äôre interested in learning more, check out their <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" official site</a>.

### <strong Flutter Setup**
The Flutter web setup should be quite easy. Just make sure that Flutter Web is enabled for the project; this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if you‚Äôre already using Flutter 3.0. Simply create a new project You can title it Flutter Crypto App or Crypto Wallet Flutter:

Done! Well, not really. You have your Flutter project setup though.

### <strong Required packages**
Of course, hats off to the Flutter community for making our tasks easy! We will be using the following package to implement our Metamask flutter integration:
- <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider" target="_blank"> provider</a>
And that‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs pretty much all you need to get into the world of Web3 via Flutter3.

### <strong ‚ÄçCoding**
Ready? Here we go!
First, we will be setting up our provider for Metamask. Start here:
We‚Äôll be needing the following variables to manage various scenarios:

Don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôll explain all of this!
- currentAddress ‚Üí The present address of our Metamask.
- operatingChain ‚Üí The Ethereum chain we‚Äôll be operating on. For now, it will be test networks, so we set it to 4 (Rinkeby Test Network).
- isEnabled ‚Üí Checks whether the browser supports Metamask.
- isInOperatingChain ‚Üí A bool variable that tells, whether we are connected to the correct chain or not.
- isConnected ‚Üí A state that shows whether Metamask has been connected or not.

Let me break it down for you:
- Get the accounts on Ethereum
- If the accounts are not empty, get the first address
- Get the ID of the current chain.

To initialize, we need to clear the currentAddress and reset the currentChain for two conditions every time:
- If the chain itself changed
We‚Äôre done with one ‚Äú3‚Äù‚Äî the Web3 part. Now it‚Äôs time for Flutter3.

Now, we‚Äôll make a button to start connecting to Metamask with conditions.

Sadly, Metamask doesn‚Äôt work in debug mode, so you have to run the web server for Flutter web and visit the URL.

In case you want to hot reload/restart, after pressing ‚Äúr‚Äù in the terminal, make sure to reload the web browser yourself.

And that‚Äôs all! üòÄ Both of our ‚Äú3s‚Äù are together and the combined effect will look something like this!
