# Pieces User Stories: Keeping track of great ideas
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Commander Mark has been here since the beginning. As one of our founding engineers, he spends most of his time deep in the code, and the rest of his time talking about code with the rest of the team.

Mark uses Pieces every day, and the way he uses it shifts constantly. “Right now, I use Pieces to save a lot of my responses that are not available on the web. Specifically with any sort of command I would use with the G Cloud APIs, as well as small templates of code, like my try catches— I’ll actually just right-click, hit “Send to Pieces” and auto-complete them into IntelliJ, VS Code or any one of my editors.”

While looking through his saved snippets, nearly every one elicits, “So this is a really useful snippet.” And when asked how he could use them without Pieces, Mark seems stumped.
