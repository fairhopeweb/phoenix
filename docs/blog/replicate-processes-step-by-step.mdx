title: Pieces User Stories | Replicate processes step-by-step
description: I like to save shell commands in Pieces, because in my workflow, I'm usually in the shell at the very start of designing a product, when I'm manipulating data. A lot of these commands I only use once every three or four weeks. An example would be things like commands to shuffle and select data points from a nested directory, or a sequence of commands to set up a cloud instance or push data to it.

export const Tag = props => {
    return <div style={{ padding: "2px 16px", borderRadius: "20px", border: "1px solid gray", maxWidth: "fit-content" }}>
        { props.children }
    </div>
};

export const GridFlexRow = props => {
    return <div style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        justifyContent: 'start',
        flexWrap: "nowrap"
    }}>{props.children}</div>;

“I like to save shell commands in Pieces, because in my workflow, I'm usually in the shell at the very start of designing a product, when I'm manipulating data. A lot of these commands I only use once every three or four weeks. An example would be things like commands to shuffle and select data points from a nested directory, or a sequence of commands to set up a cloud instance or push data to it. What I used to have to do was launch on a sort of exploration mission to try and find all the commands again or go through my internet history. Now it's just massively easier.”
