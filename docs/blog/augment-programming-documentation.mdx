> It's really helpful to just copy and paste a piece of code into Pieces and get a more definitive answer as to what the language is, what the related links and tags are, and other stuff that Pieces generates to get more context about the code. Sometimes I don't want to read all the documentation. I just want quick, short, simple answers as to what this thing does.
