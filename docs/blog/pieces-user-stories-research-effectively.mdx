# Pieces User Stories: Research effectively & store a version history
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Karam hasn’t been using Pieces for long, but he’s well on his way to becoming a power user. In his first two days as a full-time developer, he used Pieces, “a sh*t ton.”

Perhaps his most versatile use of Pieces is to save various solutions for a bug so that he can test them later— and find them in the future. “To solve a problem I do this batch research flow. I google my problem and then I go through promising solutions one at a time and try and use it to quickly solve the problem, but then many times they don't work. But, I probably want to come back to this because there's a chance I just did it wrong, or maybe it kind of worked and I need to come back to it. Sometimes I solved a problem in a niche way, usually with the help of a post, Stack Overflow or some Github issue. It’s likely that in the future, this very niche problem is going to come up again, and I've forgotten what I just did. So, I copy the link and paste it into Pieces.”

Keeping his links in Pieces saves him time and makes it exponentially easier to find a solution later.
