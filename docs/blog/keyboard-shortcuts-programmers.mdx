Mouses are slow. Keyboards are fast. If you’re a developer, use keyboard shortcuts for programmers to drastically increase your productivity in web browsers, IDEs and code snippet tools like <a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank"> Pieces for Developers</a>.

## The Case for Keyboard Shortcuts
According to Brainscape...

A single keystroke may shave "0.4 seconds" from your daily routine, but think about how frequently you reach for your mouse. &nbsp;We're talking hours per week, days per month, weeks per year.
More importantly, **keyboard shortcuts keep you in your flow and let you work at the speed of thought**.

With some practice, you’ll be able to quickly perform key tasks and navigate menus in your browser, IDE and tools like <a href="http://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank"> Pieces for Developers</a> without ever touching that dreaded mouse.


### The Browser

Let’s start with the good ol’ browser, where you’re probably doing a lot of your development research (and checking crypto prices, flicking through YouTubes and I don’t want to know what else).

Vimium — often referred to as the “hacker’s browser” — is a popular <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb" target="_blank"> Chrome extension</a> (with a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/" target="_blank" port to Firefox</a>) that allows you to navigate the web using just your keyboard! Shortcuts are based on the <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" Vim text editor</a>.
Some power shortcuts in the GIF below include:
- Scrolling up and down ( j, k)
- Switching between tabs ( J, K)

### Developer Workflow Tools

Code snippets are an incredibly helpful way to save time by not re-writing the same code or re-searching for solved solutions. But, it’s always been a hassle to save and work with code snippets.<a href="http://code.pieces.app/" ‍</a>
<a href="http://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank"> Pieces for Developers</a> is a popular new tool that enables you to save code snippets in less than a second from your code editor or any web page in Chrome and Edge.
And as you can guess, Pieces shortcuts are the heart of this beautifully intuitive app.

Just highlight your snippet and click ```⌥ + ⌘ + P (Mac)``` or  ```Ctrl + Alt + P (Windows)```.

The Pieces for Developers <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm?hl=en" target="_blank"> Chrome extension</a> makes saving code from the internet a breeze.

Highlight the desired code and hit **⌘ + Shift + P** (Mac) or **Alt + Shift + P** **twice** (Windows).Even easier, while this isn’t technically a keyboard shortcut, Pieces pops up a “Save” button when it detects code on a webpage. A single click will save that snippet.

To find a snippet in Pieces for Developers, just hit **/** and start searching.
What’s even more helpful is that Pieces for Developers automatically adds the source URL to the snippet as a Related Link. This is one of my favorite features and I no longer have endlessly cluttered Stack Overflow bookmarks with no context.
You can view and manage your related links by hitting **⌘** + **K** (Mac) or **Ctrl** + **K** (Windows).

There are loads of other great keyboard shortcuts throughout Pieces. Hover over almost any action and you’ll see a shortcut option.

Some of my favorites include:
- Edit the description: **⌘ + N / Ctrl + N**
- Reclassify the snippet language:** ```⌘ + Y``` ```Ctrl + Y```
- Open the Quick Menu actions: **⌘ + O / Ctrl + O**

### Code Editors
When it’s time to get down to coding, the mouse is your enemy. Let’s look at some critical coding keyboard shortcuts for two popular editors:
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"> VS Code</a> is one of the most popular free code editors, with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode" target="_blank"> extensions</a> for all kinds of programming languages and projects. There are dozens of VS Code shortcuts for all sorts of development tasks.

<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html" target="_blank"> IntelliJ</a> comes jammed with built-in shortcuts and has a <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank"> robust library of plugins</a> to boost your productivity.

<a href="https://github.com/Guake/guake/blob/master/README.rst" target="_blank"> Guake</a> is triggered by a hotkey that drops down a terminal over your desktop, and retreats when that same hotkey is pressed again.
It's only available for Linux machines running <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank"> Gnome</a> as their desktop environments.
