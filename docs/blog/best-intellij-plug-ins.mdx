# The 10 Best IntelliJ Plug-Ins
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Modern developers are looking for an IDE that increases usability and supports diverse plugins. IntelliJ comes bundled with many plugins, such as Maven Helper, Gradle, and Docker, but it also supports tons of other IntelliJ plugins that work seamlessly. So, there is no shortage of choices. In this article, you’ll learn about the 10 best IntelliJ plugins for various development tasks.

## Why Use IntelliJ Plugins?

A plugin is an extension or an add-on from the IntelliJ plugin marketplace that helps developers add features to an existing program. There are many benefits to using plugins, especially when it comes to writing and maintaining code. As developers widely use IntelliJ, the plugins available on the JetBrains Marketplace are extensive and offer a wide variety of options.
There are different types of IntelliJ plugins that can be useful for developers:

- Code versioning plugins
- Debugging plugins
- Collaboration plugins
- Formatting plugins
- User interface plugins
- Custom language support plugins

## Why are the Best IntelliJ Plugins Helpful?
 
**Less time to write code:** While there are many purposes to plugins, most aim to reduce the time it takes to write code. A developer can manage huge projects without manually going through every block of code. For example, some plugins make it easier to search within your code.
**Coding assistance through auto-code completion:** Some plugins make suggestions on what comes next based on programming language, among other factors, which programmers can find very helpful. In fact, some AI-based plugins for IntelliJ learn a developer’s way of writing code and make suggestions accordingly. This helps the developer to complete tasks faster.
**Debugging assistance:** Some plugins help with debugging code, which improves the overall quality of your project and helps to reduce the time taken to fix any errors.
**Easier code analysis:** Plugins can reduce code complexity, which makes analyzing code much easier. Unit testing, for example, can be simplified by analyzing code coverage with plugins like SonarQube.
**Accessible code snippet management:** Some of the latest plugins make it easier to manage code snippets so that you can spend less time finding, re-typing or re-searching for code.

## The 10 Best IntelliJ Plugins on the Market
While there’s a wide variety of plugins that developers can use, this article lists some of the best plugins that are supported by IntelliJ. These plugins were chosen based on ease of use, authentic reviews by developers, support for various languages and frameworks, and number of downloads.
Plugins like Maven Helper, GitToolBox, and WakaTime, for example, were chosen for their ease of use, while plugins like Tabnine, Pieces, AWS ToolKit, and the others were selected based on reviews, community support, and advanced capabilities. Most importantly, they were personally tried and tested.

### 1)&nbsp;Maven Helper
<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7179-maven-helper" target="_blank">> Maven Helper</a>, by Vojtch Krassa, is excellent for IntelliJ debugging and maintaining projects with many modules. Developers are often faced with conflicts and dependencies that are difficult to manage as the project size and the code repo increases. This plugin provides easy options to navigate code dependencies and eliminate conflicts.
Maven Helper consists of actions that can run and debug Maven goals, open a terminal to the current module path, and run and debug test files. It’s one of the most popular IntelliJ plugins in the tech industry and is very easy to use. For instance, with the click of a button you can predefine and run Maven goals.

<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12798-tabnine-ai-code-completion-js-java-python-ts-rust-go-php--more" target="_blank"> Tabnine</a> is an AI code completion plugin that helps developers autocomplete their code. Machine learning tools that predict code and amplify its accuracy power this plugin. Irrespective of a programmer’s development experience, Tabnine’s AI Assistant will boost productivity by suggesting team-tailored code.
The AI Assistant learns coding patterns, suggests best practices, and adjusts to each new coding style in your team. It saves a lot of time on coding as it also supports many languages and frameworks, including Java, JavaScript, Python, Perl, React, Angular, Kotlin, SQL, Swift, Ruby, and many more.

### 3) Lightrun
Adding real-time information to running applications is a hassle that many developers face. Lightrun helps address this problem by providing a suite of tools to incorporate snapshots, metrics, and code-level logs.
This plugin can prove useful when deploying applications to production environments. The biggest benefit of using it is that it reduces time spent on debugging. Being able to view logs in real time and evaluate expressions without the need to redeploy or recompile is beneficial to everyone on the dev team.

### 4) Pieces
Experienced developers and newbies alike can find themselves saving and reusing snippets of code. <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces" target="_blank"> Pieces</a> helps you save important code snippets with just one click. It avoids using a clipboard and allows developers to capture important context about the snippet as well. This plugin also creates a well-defined index of saved code snippets and enables faster search, thereby improving productivity.
Pieces is one of the fastest and smartest AI assistants for code snippets and screenshots. One of the best IntelliJ plugins, it can run locally on the developer’s machine or connect to the cloud for sync and backup. Pieces auto-classifies the snippet by language, and automatically generates tags, titles, descriptions, and more based on the content of the snippet that’s been saved.
