The first example of this is in the creation flow, where we proactively detect and associate any sensitive information contained in a saved asset.</p><p>This model also comes with all basic CRUD operations behind secure endpoints so developers can manually add, update, and delete Sensitives at their own discretion.</p><h3 id=""emhtu"">/discovery/discover/assets</h3><p>This endpoint is designed to provide recommendations on snippets to upload. This can be useful when trying to eliminate duplicate uploads or for added security measures.</p><p>Developers simply pass a SeededAsset list with the option to automatically upload, and we return the snippets we believe you should upload. If automatic is set to true, we will upload them for you!</p><h3 id=""cjdsk"">/discovery/discover/sensitives</h3><p>Discover sensitives is a way to detect if an arbitrary string contains any sensitive data. This is a great way to know whether or not to have added security features around a snippet.</p><p>This endpoint accepts a list of strings with the option to automatically upload, and we return all the detected sensitive data. If an asset is associated and automatic is set to true, we will automatically attach this sensitive information to the asset.</p><h3 id=""7s0f4"">/database/import &amp; /database/export</h3><p>With the addition of /database/import and /database/export endpoints, a developer now has the ability to export their entire database and import it on another machine. We are very excited about this capability and the features it will unlock for teams and enterprises.</p><h3 id=""7mgvm"">/linkify/multiple</h3><p>This endpoint paves the way for the first version of collections. With this, a developer can take a list of multiple assets and generate a single link representing all of them. You can see this in action with the Pieces Collections at <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/collections"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">code.pieces.app/collections</a>.</p><h2 id=""3mijc"">Support</h2><p>As always, if you run into issues or have feedback, please fill out <a href=""https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this quick form</a> or email us at <a href=""mailto:support@pieces.app"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">support@pieces.app</a> and we’ll be in touch as soon as possible!</p>

Less than one week into 2023, we’re already rolling out releases focused on supercharging developer productivity. To date, we have been hard at work enabling our users to easily save, search, share and reuse Code Snippets and other helpful materials from their developer workflow. As the team moves into Q1 you’ll see us not only refining our top feature set; but further, layering in complimentary workflow experiences that have big benefits to your work-in-progress productivity as a whole. </p><p>That said, we’re getting started with two nice quality-of-life enhancements that are especially useful when saving: Suggested Smart Indentation and Preview Before Paste. Beyond that, we’re even more excited about an awesome upgrade to the Workflow Activity View released at the end of last year.</p><h2 id=""f34rp"">Workflow Activity - Seriously Enhanced Developer Productivity</h2><p>Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the hardest elements of being a developer. With that in mind, we’re excited to release a second beta update of the “Workflow Activity” feature which launched at the end of 2022. With this update, Workflow Activity now makes it easier than ever to backtrack through your work in progress journey and access useful metadata associated with your saved snippets.</p><p>In addition to providing users insights to how they are using Pieces, Workflow Activity enables users to quickly find and access related links, shared snippets, associated tags, snippet collaborators, and other metadata that is connected to your saved materials.</p><p>We are really excited about how this new Workflow Activity View perfectly compliments the default Snippet Gallery View and beyond that, we are even more excited about doubling down on our goal to allow your workflow to resume without friction.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""Using the updated Workflow Activity view to find a site that you previously visited."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63bc4925a5cf1e29e4a3161c_ActivityViewOpenRelatedLinkViewSavedPiece_201758073ac366f4f8dbcd2afd3b4ad1.gif"" /></div></figure><h2 id=""a9ru5"">Not sure what’s on your clipboard?

Over time, we’ll become even more deeply connected to GitHub and your other favorite dev tools.</p><h3 id=""brgr0"">10X Collaboration with Sharing via GitHub Gists</h3><p>Increase collaboration with your team, mentees, or developers around the world by sharing your saved materials via GitHub Gists! The Pieces for Developers Desktop App now provides users with another easy, flexible way to share their code snippets— and all their context(!)— with others. With the click of a button, turn your saved material into a public or private GitHub Gist that you can view in GitHub and share with others.</p><p>To do this, open the Link Sharing Menu and you’ll see a new option: “Share via Gist.” Once selected, you’ll be prompted to connect your GitHub account and then generate a Gist with a custom name and description, or the same ones as your Pieces asset. You can also choose to change the Gist from Public to Private (all Gists will be public by default).</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""Demonstration of sharing a Gist in Pieces."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6400b87f7158f5227ab09ba5_sharing-gists_f9224fbf5a878ec2ffa6da0939de6707.gif"" /></div></figure><p>After creating the Gist, you can either open or copy the link, and share away! If you edit the snippet in Pieces for Developers, no worries, you can update or redo the corresponding Gist. 😊</p><p>We’re thrilled to embed Pieces for Developers even more deeply into your current workflow and to give you an additional way to collaborate with developers around the globe.</p><h3 id=""ea7b9"">Existing GitHub Gists, Meet Pieces for Developers</h3><p>Already have GitHub Gists? Amazing! 🥳 We’re giving GitHub Gist users a super simple way to automatically import their Gists to Pieces for Developers. This is helpful for a variety of reasons:</p><ol type=""1""><li>Automatically enrich your Gists with contextual metadata, such as related websites &amp; links, related people, natural language descriptions, and more.</li><li>Find your Gists extremely easily without ever opening your browser, and even directly within your IDE using the Pieces for Developers VS Code or JetBrains Plugins.</li></ol><p>Importing your existing Gists in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App is simple:</p><ol type=""1""><li>Choose the “Discover” option above your Snippet Carousel</li><li>Choose the option “Select Gists”</li><li>Make sure Pieces is connected to your GitHub account</li><li>Browse your Gists in the Desktop App and select the ones you’d like to import</li><li>Done! 🎉</li></ol><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""A demonstration of importing your Gists to Pieces."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6400b87f7158f54c29b09ba4_import-gist_95cc4105553815bfbe812b7d0a51f188.gif"" /></div></figure><p>Overall, this feature represents a major step forward in our mission to provide users with the most seamless and intuitive coding experience possible. Whether you&#x27;re a seasoned developer or just starting out, the ability to import your existing GitHub Gists is sure to make your life as a developer easier.</p><h2 id=""1kct8"">General Snippet Discovery Improvements</h2><p>Snippet Discovery is an extremely unique, helpful feature our team is proud to have introduced for our users. In Pieces for Developers 1.11.0, Snippet Discovery got some exciting UI upgrades and performance improvements to make the process easier, more precise, and much faster.</p><p>Most notably, you will notice larger code previews that have more space for top-level context about the snippet. Today, when importing GitHub Gists, you’ll notice Related People associated with those Gists, but in the near future, we’re excited to surface Smart Descriptions, Related Links, and more. Stay tuned! 😇</p><h2 id=""3fp3k"">Smarter, Faster Search with 3 New Search Modes</h2><p>As our users save more and more materials, we want them to find 🔍 these materials as quickly as possible, and in a manner that works best for them. This release comes with three exciting search modes you can toggle right from the search bar, and customize to your liking via the Settings Menu.</p><ol type=""1""><li>Blended: Search against code, tags, descriptions, people, and related links</li><li>Full Text Search (FTS): Search against the code or text values of the saved material</li><li>Neural Code Search (NCS): Search via natural language to find certain materials based on a set of ML-based heuristics</li></ol><p>To change your current search mode, simply click the search icon in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App Search Bar.</p><p>To change your default search mode, navigate to the “Customize” section in the Desktop App Settings Menu.

If you haven’t already, check out the plugin <a href=""https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.</p><h2 id=""71og4"">5. 6 Pieces Web Extension Releases</h2><p>The Pieces Web Extension is a little different from our IDE extensions— it really streamlines the saving process when you’re hunting for code solutions around the web. This year we transformed our web extension from a single-button “Save this code” extension to a truly useful, fully customizable tool that helps you save snippets without digging back through your search results. Save the code you need in less than a second (yes, really!) <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">right now</a>.</p><h2 id=""eqgrs"">6. 120 Published Blog Articles</h2><p>Our ultimate goal is to be helpful to fellow developers. As part of that goal, this year, we launched our <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/content-partner"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Content Partner Program</a> and published 120+ technical articles that are deeply helpful to the entire dev community. Check out our <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/blog"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog</a> to learn about anything from <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/blog/how-to-write-test-and-deploy-ethereum-smart-contracts-using-truffle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">writing smart contracts</a> to <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/blog/dart-on-cli-foundations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">building Dart CLIs</a>.</p><h2 id=""arru4"">7. 10 Published YouTube Videos</h2><p>Did you know that we have a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/@getpieces/featured"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">YouTube channel</a>? We launched it this year so that we can create and share video tutorials about the Pieces for Developers Suite. Our first 10 videos are live— subscribe so you don’t miss any tutorials, power tips, or workflow hacks in 2023!</p><h2 id=""5g680"">8. 3 Team Meetups</h2><p>From Poland to San Francisco, our team is spread across seven countries. While we connect virtually almost every day, it’s always more fun to gather in person! This year, we gathered (nearly) the entire team three times, twice in Cincinnati and once in Lisbon, Portugal. All three meetups were productive, innovative, and a whole lot of fun.</p><h2 id=""3db30"">9. Auto-generated metadata</h2><p>Our Machine Learning and Infrastructure teams do an incredible job of developing models that automatically generate tags, descriptions, snippet classifications, related links, related people, and more. This year, all of those models were integrated into our products, released to our users, <em>and</em> updated to be faster and more precise. Check out all of that sweet, sweet metadata in the Information View of the Pieces Desktop app— everything we’ve auto-generated is marked with ✨.</p><h2 id=""fincp"">10. Snippet Discovery in the Pieces Desktop App</h2><p>This is one of our favorites. Snippet Discovery not only extracts useful snippets from a given file or directory, it automatically enriches them and makes them instantly reusable across the Pieces suite. Snippet Discovery helps you standardize your code, share standardized snippets among your team, and saves time rewriting the same code over and over. Learn more about this game-changing feature <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-1-9-0-write-less-code-save-more-time-with-snippet-discovery"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.</p><h2 id=""2gi8a"">11. Auto-complete in the Pieces IDE Plugins</h2><p>In the first half of the year, we launched the first-ever auto-complete feature that is exclusively trained on snippets from your personal repository. In JetBrains and VS Code, Pieces suggests your snippets precisely when they’re most useful so that you don’t have to search for the right code. Read more about the release <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0-1-4-code-auto-complete-is-live"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.</p><h2 id=""5fvak"">12. Snippet Sharing via Pieces Links</h2><p>The first of many cloud-enabled features, we released snippet sharing this summer, with big updates to the feature throughout the summer and fall. Pieces links allow you to easily share a code snippet and its context with your team, your friends, or within articles and public repositories. Try it out by hitting [CTRL/CMD + L] in the desktop app or by right-clicking a snippet in the IDE plugins.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""Generating a Pieces shareable link."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63c1a51eee03b61664a8292b_shareable-link_def783ee88a89bdc150d0eccc5971d18.gif"" /></div></figure><h2 id=""bkkgc"">13. Auto-saved Git Context in the IDE Plugins</h2><p>Every developer uses Git. As of this fall, any snippet you create in our IDE plugins automatically includes extra-helpful context from your Git history, like code authors, commit messages, files, projects and more— in addition to all of the other context Pieces captures. Read more about it in the <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0117-gitmore-context"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">release notes</a>.</p><h2 id=""eru5r"">14. Workflow Activity in the Pieces Desktop App</h2><p>Our latest release includes an early preview of Workflow Activity view, a chronological timeline of when you create, delete, share, and manage context for your snippets. We’re working hard on the next version of this view to make it even more useful for your workflow! Keep an eye out for exciting changes in 2023.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""Scrolling through Workflow Activity in the Pieces desktop app."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63bc4925a5cf1e29e4a3161c_ActivityViewOpenRelatedLinkViewSavedPiece_201758073ac366f4f8dbcd2afd3b4ad1.gif"" /></div></figure><h2 id=""92jfv"">15. Snippet Discovery in the Web Extension</h2><p>We know how vital the <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Web Extension</a> is to save snippets quickly from around the web and capture helpful context to find snippets easier later on. Earlier this month, we released Snippet Discovery in the Web Extension, which remembers the last 100 snippets you’ve come across while browsing and allows you to save them with one click from the popover menu. No more retracing your steps!</p><h2 id=""9qt53"">16. Linux Compatibility across the entire Pieces for Developers Suite</h2><p>We’ve been working on this one all year— the Pieces Suite is now compatible with Linux operating systems. We’re thrilled to support developers on every operating system! If you’re interested in trying the Beta version of our Linux-compatible Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop app, download it <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/install"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.</p><h2 id=""6702r"">17. Snippet Editing across the entire Pieces for Developers Suite</h2><p>Saving code is already awesome, but easily editing what you’ve saved so that it’s exactly what you want? That’s even better. In April, we shipped <a href=""https://code.pieces.app/updates/snippet-editing-is-live"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">snippet editing</a> in the Pieces Desktop App, quickly followed by snippet editing in our IDE plugins in May. With a super simple keyboard shortcut or right-click, you can customize your code and save it for easy re-use later.</p><h2 id=""8s52u"">18. Manage snippets from our IDE plugins</h2><p>Do you remember December 2021? Way back then, in order to manage your snippets and their metadata, you had to do it in the Pieces desktop app. These days, you can do all of that from your IDE by leveraging our VS Code and JetBrains plugins— all you need is Pieces OS.</p><h2 id=""2ems8"">19. APILayer Partnership &amp; the Launch of TLP APIs</h2><p>In March, we launched a partnership with APILayer to bring developers all over the world access to our suite of Technical Language Processing (TLP) APIs. The first API we launched was our Code Detection API, which has implications for messaging apps, word and code processing apps, and hundreds of other apps. Read more about the launch in <a href=""https://apilayer.com/press/apilayer-and-pieces-launch-api-partnership"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this press release</a>!</p><h2 id=""5ihp4"">20. StartupCincy Week</h2><p>In mid-October, hundreds of Cincinnati’s brightest startup founders, investors, and early employees gathered to build community and spark innovation at <a href=""https://startupcincy.com/startupcincyweek/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">StartupCincy Week</a>. Mack, one of our co-founders, offered wisdom to aspiring founders at the Welcome Breakfast, we chatted with budding talent at the Startup Cincy Job Fair, and our entire team cheered on five of Cincinnati’s top startups at the Cincy’s Got Startups Happy Hour. We’re honored to be building a world-class company right here in Cincinnati alongside so many other talented teams.</p><h2 id=""3sm95"">21. Named Best Tech Startup in Cincinnati</h2><p>We’re absolutely blown away to have been named the <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/inno/stories/awards/2022/06/24/inno-fire-winners.html?taid=62b5a7427240840001f2cb00&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=trueanthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Best Tech Startup in Cincinnati</a> by Cincinnati Inno last July.

Today, we’re making it easier to save, reclassify, and reuse code within your JetBrains IDE with Drag and Drop. This new feature makes managing your code snippets even more seamless and efficient. We’re also adding customizations to your Search Everywhere experience so that Pieces does exactly what you want it to do.</p><h2 id=""a7ra1"">Drag and Drop</h2><p>Saving, reclassifying and reusing code were already pretty simple, but now they’re even simpler— all you have to do is drag a snippet around your JetBrains IDE. There are three specific features supported by Drag and Drop:</p><h3 id=""1tbva"">Create a Snippet</h3><p>Highlight some code in your editor and drag it to the Pieces window to save it as a new snippet. Pieces automatically associates all of the usual context with the new snippet, but if you want to ensure that it’s classified as a certain language, just drag it to that section of the List View.</p><h3 id=""2ma6g"">Reclassify a Snippet</h3><p>Along with classifying a new snippet, dragging an existing snippet from one language to another will automatically reclassify it. These changes are reflected in the Pieces desktop app, as well!</p><h3 id=""587mo"">Reuse a Snippet</h3><p>Finally, it just got super simple to place a snippet exactly where you want it in your editor. Just drag a snippet from your Pieces list to wherever you want it to be, then keep on coding.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""Using drag and drop in Pieces for JetBrains."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63e17ed29437d818eeef70b7_DRAG_AND_DROP_FAST_bcb4e7efb571b6f9f7462a6af8497bba.gif"" /></div></figure><h2 id=""2ni2q"">Customized Search</h2><p>You can now customize what happens after you select the snippet you just searched for. From the Pieces for JetBrains settings, you can choose the following search result actions:</p><ul><li>Open the snippet (default)</li><li>Insert the snippet</li><li>Open the snippet and copy it to your clipboard</li><li>Copy the snippet to your clipboard</li></ul><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img alt=""Adjusting your settings in Pieces for JetBrains."" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6421f9b84acfe5851421f8f7_SEARCH_SETTINGS_INTELLIJ_7b630d69b345cbf985c5b8ea49d6dba9.gif"" /></div></figure><p>To insert the snippet you just searched for, hold ⌥ option on MacOS or Alt on Windows and click where you’d like the snippet to be.
