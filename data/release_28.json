  "MainBody": "<h2 id=\"94oct\">Create a new snippet from an existing one. Duplicate. Edit. Save. 😎</h2><p>Hope everyone is excited to try out our new snippet duplication feature! As developers, we often copy and paste code and then make edits in-line. But it’s helpful to have the original version in case you need it later.</p><p>With snippet duplication, you can press ⌘+D or open the quick menu and select “Duplicate Snippet” when looking at a code snippet in your Pieces for Developers window, and it will duplicate that snippet so you have a new version that you can work on.</p><p>Check it out in action here: </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"Duplicating a snippet in the Pieces desktop app.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6345ad5b03255e892da27152_ezgif_com-gif-maker_3896c72d0613d4eb36929529b659d3ce.gif\" /></div></figure><h2 id=\"f129k\">Auto-Update Sharable Links 🔗</h2><p>With today’s release, shareable links will update on their own without having to do “update link”  manually. Changed the title? Updated. Created a custom domain so your links have your name in them? Updated and your links now look polished without having to manually update every shared snippet you sent in the past.</p><p>The best part is when you change data that is on a shareable link inside of the code snippet itself, that will update too. So anyone who uses a link that was created in the past can stay up to date with any changes made to a snippet in the future.</p><p>To enable auto-updating, first create a shareable link, then change data to get the notification. Here is an example of what that popup looks like:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A prompt to update an edited shareable link.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6345ad5b03255e9fb3a27151_updatesharablelink_bcfe6b373b97e7876128b453fd6fe4e3_800.png\" /></div></figure><p>If you click “Don’t ask me again” - Pieces will auto-update in the background whenever your snippet changes.</p><h2 id=\"evlbf\">Bugs, anyone? 🐛</h2><p>More bugs squashed, which means a smoother experience for you as these new features come out. </p><p>Some of you reported issues with opening shared snippets in the browser, so we upgraded a lot of small things around the sharing experience. Some other small patches include the following:</p><ul><li>Updates to issues with flashing screens during onboarding</li><li>Improvements to the shareable link logic for smoother transitions from the browser into Pieces</li><li>More clickable area added to the “suggested tag” section of the tags menu</li></ul><h2 id=\"1grao\">Try new features before everyone else </h2><p>Sign up for the beta program to get access to new features before they’re deployed to all users.
