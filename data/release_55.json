  "MainBody": "<p>It‚Äôs been a big month at Pieces, with five released updates to the Pieces for Developers Suite and nearly two dozen published articles, among other accomplishments. We wanted to take a moment to highlight our favorite Pieces features, a few of our top authors (and their articles) and other milestones that we hit in October. </p><h4 id=\"36flv\">Milestones of the Month</h4><ol type=\"1\"><li>Pieces for VS Code has been installed more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getpieces/status/1586077973110669312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10,000 times</a> üéâ</li><li>More than 2,000 people read our blog in October üìñ</li></ol><h4 id=\"di26p\">Features of the Month</h4><p>Our engineering team has pushed a monster 5 releases this month! We‚Äôre particularly excited about two brand-new features that landed in our Plugins: ‚ÄúSave to Pieces As‚Äù in Pieces for JetBrains and auto-captured Git History snippet enrichment in Pieces for VS Code and Pieces for JetBrains.</p><p><strong>Save to Pieces As</strong></p><p>Just like the ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù you know and love, ‚ÄúSave to Pieces As‚Äù allows you to adjust a snippet‚Äôs auto-generated context before you save it. With pre-generated enrichment, including a title, tags, a description, related links, related people and more, it‚Äôs super simple to add a more descriptive title or remove an unnecessary tag.
