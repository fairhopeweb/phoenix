Due to the way the base docs.page system works, this file serves as a "how to" on using the repo.


=================== [Changing the base domain] ===================

The base domain is set to:

>>>  https://code.pieces.app

To replace the domain throughout the project you can find and replace the above link, and all paths will be similar with
the new domain following the end of the base url.

so:

>>>  https://code.pieces.app/updates

would become

>>>  https://new.domain.com/updates
