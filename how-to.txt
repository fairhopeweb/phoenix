Due to the way the base docs.page system works, this file serves as a "how to" on using the repo.


=================== [Changing the base domain] ===================

The base domain is set to:

>>>  https://code.pieces.app

To replace the domain throughout the project you can find and replace the above link, and all paths will be similar with
the new domain following the end of the base url.

so:

>>>  https://code.pieces.app/updates

would become

>>>  https://new.domain.com/updates

================= [Header Icon Navigation] =====================

This can be a little interesting - especially during testing. The default for docs.page is to set the base URL to
the link that is on the href when that button/icon is clicked. In order for the proper functionality, you have to make sure that:

index.mdx file is set as so

---
redirect: https://code.pieces.app
---

that way when the icon is pressed the redirect pushes from there. Important because otherwise there really isnt a button
to get to the home page outside of the existing bottom navigation.
